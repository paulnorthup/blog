title: What happened to the "Renaissance Man"?
---

It seems like these days everything is about specialization.  People are so stressed out about finding their niche that they can't focus on any one thing.  "Oh I want to do this, but does it align with what my career will be for the rest of my life?  Does it make enough money?  I love art but I have to be an engineer!"

To these folks I have one piece of advice:
<blockquote>Do what you love.</blockquote>
If you love everything, do everything.  Why should something take the back burner because it's not in your field of study?  Do what feels right!

The Renaissance Man idea (from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath">Wikipedia</a>):
<blockquote>A polymath (Greek πολυμαθής, polymathēs, "having learned much")[1] is a person whose expertise spans a significant number of different subject areas. In less formal terms, a polymath (or polymathic person) may simply be someone who is very knowledgeable.</blockquote>
When did it become bad to learn about everything?  Since when does broadening knowledge and perspective hurt?  We need to slow things down a bit and realize that if knowledge really is power, why do we pigeonhole ourselves from early on?

I'm still chewing on this idea but I like where it's going, and it's inspired me to make some changes in my own life that I deem are for the better.  Try taking a chance and open up to new ideas.  Try to learn something, <em>really</em> learn something well, every day.  You just might like it.
