title: Book: The Doors of Perception - Aldous Huxley
---

A quick read by Aldous Huxley, though the language is pretty tough in some places. I thought this book was really inspiring, and gave a good look into the minds of people, moreso than most may be comfortable with. Good stuff, really deep, food for thought. Maybe not a must read, but if you're looking to get really out there, definitely give it a shot.
