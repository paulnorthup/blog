Front-end development has always been a game of hunt-and-peck, google, debug, try some more, get it right. Along the way I've put together a slew of bookmarks I found interesting, as well as a few sites that are that are the tried and true reference sites I've been coming back to for years. Here are a some of them:
<h2>CSS Basics</h2>
The old tried and true <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/default.asp">W3Schools</a> site is one of the better references for css properties out there. They are all listed, and can be tools in your toolbelt once you understand them.

Smashing Magazine has always been a huge help for me, with explanations of trends and movements, along with tricks of the trade. One of their great articles covers <a href="http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2010/04/07/css-specificity-and-inheritance/">CSS specificity and inheritance</a>. This is a crucial building block. Check out some other Smashing mag articles on CSS <a href="http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/tag/css/">here</a><a href="http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2010/04/07/css-specificity-and-inheritance/">
</a>

<a href="http://sixrevisions.com/css/css-tips/css-tip-2-structural-naming-convention-in-css/">Structural Naming Conventions</a> are a good way to keep yourself sane working with CSS. Other SixRevisions articles on css can be found <a href="http://sixrevisions.com/css/">here</a>.
<h2>CSS Tricks/Tips</h2>
<a href="http://css-tricks.com/snippets/">CSS-Tricks</a> has a ton of snippets to play with. These are css effects that you can drop into your designs, and alter to suit your needs.

Your best friend in the trick/tip arena is Google. If you can learn the basics above, then searching accurately for what you're trying to make can often offer you tutorials, tips, and tricks. There's no shame in using Google to learn, and trust me, in front-end, you're going to be learning every day.
<h2>Typography</h2>
There are a lot of opinions about type on the web. Some of mine align with these sites. I'll let them do the talking.

A List Apart has a few articles, these two should get you started: <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/on-web-typography">On Web Typography</a>, and <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/more-meaningful-typography">More Meaningful Typography</a>.

A typography template like <a href="http://typeplate.com/">Typeplate</a> can help you frame your site's type (and <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/02/27/typeplate-for-beautiful-web-type/">Smashing Mag's post</a> explains how it works).<em id="__mceDel">

With these as a (pretty thick) introduction to web typography, follow your questions for more in-depth articles.
<h2>Frameworks and Grid Systems</h2>
There are a few frameworks that have really caught my eye over the past few years. One of the first, and well-praised, is the <a href="http://960.gs">960 Grid System</a>.

Outside of that, are a handful of grid systems that support responsive design. The leaders in that arena are <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a> and <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a>. These are by no means the only ones available. There's a list of quite a few front-end frameworks for you to browse over at this <a href="http://usablica.github.com/front-end-frameworks/compare.html?v=2.0">CSS Front-End Frameworks</a> comparison site.
<h2>Responsive</h2>
Responsive design can be a lot to get your head around in one day. The underlying concepts aren't too difficult, but the technicalities are many. The best practices are also changing quickly, as this is a new field. Here are some sites to get you primed and ready:

Ethan Marcotte's <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design">Responsive Web Design</a> is the mother of all articles on responsive. Take your time to dig through this one, it's fantastic. A List Apart has a slew of other <a href="http://alistapart.com/topic/responsive-design">responsive articles</a> as well.

Another <a href="http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/01/12/guidelines-for-responsive-web-design/">introduction to responsive design</a> comes from Smashing Magazine.

<a href="http://alistapart.com/article/fluid-images">Fluid Images</a> are a tough piece to handle when building responsive sites, but this will certainly help guide you in the right direction.

These articles aren't the latest and greatest responsive tricks, but they will help build your core understanding of how responsive works.
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
As you have probably noticed, most of my reference material for CSS comes from either Smashing Mag, or A List Apart. I had trouble with information overload early-on, and needed some guidance to move forward on developing sites. I felt like I was spinning my wheels reading tons of articles and creating nothing on my own. I decided to pick a few web publications that had exemplary articles and respected authors, and ignore the noise around me to keep myself sane. It has turned out pretty well, and I suggest you do the same. Otherwise you may know a lot, but only build a little, and the real learning comes from building.
