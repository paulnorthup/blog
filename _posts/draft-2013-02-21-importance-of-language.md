title: On the importance of language

Language and vocabulary

it's how we communicate

it's how ideas pass between us

the mastery of it allows us to communicate better, more accurately

take things into account like:

- honed, focused argument

- take into account common rebuttals in initial pitch

- emotion tied to argument

- express the argument and our perception of it separately

- allow our mind to express more developed/complete ideas

- allow the recipient to understand more fully

brain to brain communication, language/vocabulary and their mutual understanding is the lowest common denominator

- we all need to do it

- doesn't help if only you take on the challenge of expression, the other party must be able to receive as well.
