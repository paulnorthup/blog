I'd like to argue for the value of looking at code through the lens of art.

Assume art is the expression of creativity. You have a free canvas to do whatever you'd like.

Now although this canvas is a blank canvas, there are certainly some limitations. With regard to pastels, the quality of your chalk may be an issue. With paint and brush, there can be issues with length of handle, length of bristle, etc. I won't make too much of an argument here, and will assume you're on the page with me.

But art can be expressed without tools, with just the body, arguably with just the mind. To help pare down a smaller portion of the art world, and a particular portion relevant to coding, let's assume there are tools involved. Maybe there are theoretically perfect tools, like the perfect paintbrush, or the perfect .vimrc, but there are limitations all the same.

From this limitation, and with an idea in the mind, artistic vision is brought to life. The type/method of creative process falls on a spectrum.

Spectrum is classified and organized - pointilism to cubism, minimalism to classical (no current similar code classifications?).

This is the classification of style of production, not product.

Have people put together any coding style guidelines? They're currently tied to GitHub users, etc? Are there museums of code? Is code old enough yet?

I'd like to look at minimalism in detail.

There's creative complexity, and creative simplicity. Creative complexity uses problem solving mind to produce artistic solution, pleasing to the eye/soul. Â Using the creative juices for efficiency uses these forces towards understandability, ease of feature enhancement, versioning.

Creative complexity isn't wrong, but is more art than code. It does work, as it is solving problems.

Higher artists who use their creativity for simplicity, and who work to make their code easy for others to understand and work with. They are equal with respect to code, different as respect to market value. Just like extraordinary ultra-moderns go in museums, so too can classicals, but not when it comes to business.

It will take the same amount of time as a great artist, and it will cost as much as a great artist, but the point is that the product is great.

Define okay - solves some of your problems
Define good - solves all of your problems
Define great - solves all of your problems! WRONG

Great solves all your problems, <em>and</em> is thoughtfully built with foresight.
